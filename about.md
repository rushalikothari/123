title: About Me
---

Since I was a little girl, I've been interested in a lot of things. You name it, I probably did it - art, dance, basketball, gymnastics, tennis, even ice skating for a little bit. I dabbled in CS, learned about current events and situations happening around the world through Model United Nations. I worked full time doing molecular biology research for a summer.

I entered college as a Biology major, because bio came easily to me. I liked it. Things made sense. Everything has a reason for being made the way it is - form fits function. I started volunteering at a hospital at the start of my freshman year of college and fell in love with the experience of improving patient wellness. Though this volunteer position only allows us to speak with patients and nurses, I'd like to pursue this relationship further and become a physician. 

I'm currently a student at University of California, Santa Barbara, pursuing a B.S. in Biology and a certificate in Technology and Management. I will be graduating in 2020.
