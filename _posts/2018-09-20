title: A New Curiosity
---

This time, my new interest is computer science. Now, don't get me wrong. I've lived in the Silicon Valley for most of my life so of course, I coded when I was 12. I guess that doesn't really make this *new* per say. However, it is the first time, I'm interested in doing it myself. I think the issue in the past has been that I haven't been able to find a project related to CS that I've wanted to pursue. After seeing all my CS major friends make their own websites and display their accomplishments, I decided this was worth a shot. Here's to hoping I can finish it before I lose interest in CS or schoolwork makes it so that I can't. See you around!
